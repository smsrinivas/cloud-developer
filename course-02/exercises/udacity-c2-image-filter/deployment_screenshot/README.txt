I had initially forked the entire "Cloud-Developer" repo (https://github.com/udacity/cloud-developer); hence I created a project "udacity-c2-image-filter" under the same repo under course-02/exercises folder and worked on this exercise. 

My Repo Urls:
 
DEV: https://github.com/smsrinivas/cloud-developer/tree/dev  

MASTER: https://github.com/smsrinivas/cloud-developer/tree/master

STAGE: https://github.com/smsrinivas/cloud-developer/tree/stage

Feature Branch where I worked this: https://github.com/smsrinivas/cloud-developer/tree/feature/image-filter-implementation

Project Code is in Folder: course-02/exercises/udacity-c2-image-filter

Service API:=> http://udagram-image-filter-service-dev2.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage

FIRST REVIEW: 

You looked at WRONG LOCATION - https://github.com/smsrinivas/cloud-developer/blob/feature/image-filter-implementation/course-02/project/image-filter-starter-code/src/server.ts 

CORRECT LOCATION according to above is - https://github.com/smsrinivas/cloud-developer/blob/feature/image-filter-implementation/course-02/exercises/udacity-c2-image-filter/src/server.ts


PLEASE look at readme, I did mention that Project code is in Folder - "cloud-developer/course-02/exercises/udacity-c2-image-filter" not "course-02/project/image-filter-starter-code".
